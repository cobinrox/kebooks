<H1>Channeling Your inner T-Rex</H1>

<p>Inside of the 20-pound bowling ball (see <i>Bowling at 20,000 Feet</i>) is the human brain.  Some say that the modern human uses only 10% of the brain's capacity, the other 90% turning flaccid and eroding.  I tend to disagree with that, in fact I think we DO use 90% or more of our brain.  We use at least 30% for regret, resentment, and grief about the past; another 30% is spent on worries of the future; and another 30% anxiously getting through the day.  The remaining 10%?  Well that is used for the basal purpose of life: regulating breathing, heart rate, blood sugar, and other boring things.</p>

<p>This 10% (approximately-- according to Dr. Cobin, anyway) is used by the medula oblingata; the part of the brain that is common among most living creatures both current and ancient.  Whether you are a modern human or an evolutionary stunted gila monster or alligator, you all share this part of a brain.  As such, this part of the brain is often referred to as "the ancient, or reptillian brain".  I like the latter because it sounds cool.  And it helps you remembrer that even reptiles and T-Rexes share this brain functioning with you.</p>

<p>So when you are working out, it is the reptillian brain" that sends signals to your lungs to breath harder, sends messages to your heart to pump harder, and commands to your organs to release sugar into your bloodstream.  So the reptillian brain "just works" autonomously, with or without your other 90% of neurosis going on.</p>

<p>The reptillian part of the brain, though, doesn't just work for free: It requires sleep as a restorative process, required for over-all health and physical well-being.  Lack of sleep makes the reptile brain sluggish.  But, as alluded to in <i>Prone Sweet Prone</i>, there are ways to trick it.</p>

<p>How do you trick a T-Rex, you might ask.  It's not that hard, really. And, unlike a real T-Rex, the reptile brain will not get mad and try to chase and eat you when it realizes it has been tricked.</p>

<p>And when that 90% of the human brain is keeping you awake, believe it or not, as was alluded to in <i>Prone Sweet Prone</i>, the reptillian brain
