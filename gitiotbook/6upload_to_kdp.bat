@REM oh yeah you wish, you gotta do this yourself

1. Login to KDP site
2. Upload the .epub (or kcf) version when prompted, it will upload the file, but then will also
run a spell checker on it.  If you had spelling errors, you'll want to fix them locally, then
rerun the converter to epub/kcf format and then upload it again with the fixes.

3. Set up cover if you don't have one or if, updating to a new version/edition, edit the
existing cover and uplaod any new images for the cover.  It'll pop you into a very basic
image editor. For the cover, you should have just a basic image with your logo on it and then
you can add text in the cover editor on KDP.
4. Follow the rest of the prompts, you should be able to set up pricing and then hit the publish button
