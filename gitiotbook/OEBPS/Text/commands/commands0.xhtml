  <h1>Git Commands</h1>
  <p>This chapter demonstrates the basic workflow of using Git and its basic commands.  These are the common commands that you will normally be running in a multi-person team environment.</p>
  <p>The following table contains the basic Git commands that are discussed in this chapter, they are presented below in the basic order in which they are normally executed.</p>
  <p>The "Local/Remote" column is used to distinguish Git commands that work or are affected only by the local repo, on your laptop, versus whether the command works in conjunction with the remote (server/cloud) repo. It is important to understand whether a Git command that you execute either affects or works in conjunction with the remote repo.  This is a can be a cause of confusion so it is worthwhile to consider this distinction when you run a Git command.  Commands that are particularly treacherous have the Local/Remote column marked in bold font to get your attention.</p>
