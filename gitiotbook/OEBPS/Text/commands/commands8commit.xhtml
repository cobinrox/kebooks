    <h4>What it's supposed to do</h4>

  <p>Moves your changes into the "committed" state.</p>
  <p>The following example shows taking three previously-made changes (a new file, deleting a file, and changing a file) and moving all three changes from the staging area to the committed area: </p>
  <pre><span class="inner-pre" style="font-size: 10px">
    C:\Users\jsmith\constitution&gt;git status
      On branch my_new_branch
      Changes to be committed:
      (use "git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)

        modified:   ammendments.txt
        new file:   deviant_acts.txt
        deleted:    preamble

    C:\Users\jsmith\constitution&gt;git commit -m "made some fun changes bwah hahaha"
      [my_new_branch 73dffc4] made some fun changes bwah hahaha
        3 files changed, 4 insertions(+), 1 deletion(-)
        create mode 100644 deviant_acts.txt
        delete mode 100644 preamble
        
    C:\Users\jsmith\constitution&gt;git status
        On branch my_new_branch
        nothing to commit, working tree clean
  </span></pre>
  <h4><img src="../../Images/small/w4.jpg" alt=" " class="heading-icon"/> What they forgot to mention</h4>
    <p>You can probably see the possible issues in the preceeding example: After a commit, the "git status" command shows "nothing to commit, working tree clean", which may lead you to forget that you had even committed anything, let alone changed anything to the branch. If you don't believe this can happen to you because you have a perfect memory, then don't worry about it.  But, if like me, you can't remember every keystroke you've ever made, especially on a Friday at 4:30 and the network is down, then this is something to keep in mind when you do a "git status": don't get lulled into a false sense of security thinking "Oh, I haven't made any changes to this branch."</p>
    <p>To display what is in the committed area but has not yet been pushed, you can use this command:</p>
    <pre><span class="inner-pre" style="font-size: 10px">
      git show --name-only HEAD
    </span></pre>

    <p>An example showing the above three changes that were moved to the committed area is shown below.  You might run the following commands on a Monday morning:</p>
    
    <pre><span class="inner-pre" style="font-size: 10px">
    C:\Users\jsmith\constitution&gt;git show --name-only HEAD
    commit 73dffc4343c8c1ccf77e340a690b2833f61e4c9a
    Author: jsmith@email.com
    Date:   Sun Apr 2 17:33:19 2025 -0600
    
        made some fun changes bwah hahaha
    
    ammendments.txt
    deviant_acts.txt
    preamble
    </span></pre>

    <h4>Undoing files that have been committed</h4>
    <p>This command will move the changed files back to the staged area.</p>
  <pre><span class="inner-pre" style="font-size: 10px">
  git reset --soft HEAD~
  </span></pre>
  
  </div>
</body>
