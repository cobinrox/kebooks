  <p>In the remaining sub-sections, you are encouraged to follow along on your laptop.  You can refer to Appendix A: Installing Git which will walk you through installing Git on your laptop, setting you up with a Git account on GitHub, and creating a dummy repo on GitHub.</p>
  <p>Each command is shown with its basic syntax, an optional diagram showing the before and after effect of the command, and a description.  The diagrams show the branches and, for depiction on the user's local laptop, the Git Staging and Commit areas are shown, virtually.</p>
  <p>Also note that the commands (except for "git clone") are executed from within the local repository (directory) on your laptop.</p>

  <h3>git clone</h3>
  <p><b>Syntax:</b></p>
  <pre><span class="inner-pre" style="font-size: 10px">
    git clone https://github.com/projectName/repoName.git
    git clone git@github.com:projectName/repoName.git
  </span></pre>
    <div style="text-align:center;"><img src="../../Images/commands/clone.jpg" alt=" " style="width: 500px;;padding-bottom:0.2em"/><br /><i>git clone</i></div>

  <p>This command copies an existing, remote repository from the remote server (e.g. from GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.) down to the user's laptop. The syntax of the command comes in two flavors, depending on whether you have registered a Secure Shell (SSH) key with the remote server.  The first syntax example shows the command used if you do not have an account or have not registered an SSH key on the Git server; the second example, which is preferred, shows the command if you do have a registered key on the Git server.</p>
    
  <p>The HTTPS version may be desired to first get your feet wet with Git, but the SSH version is preferred because it allows you to perform the Git commands that involve the remote server without having to provide your credentials each time.  Setting up and registering an SSH key is shown in Appendix A so you are encouraged to do so, especially in your work/employment environment.</p>
  <p>When downloading the repo, a new directory is created with the name of the repo.  For example, if the name of the remote repo were "constitution", then after cloning the repo from the remote server, you will have a shiny new directory called "constitution".  The directory will contain the same files and branches that are on the master branch on the remote repo.  Additionally, it will also have a special, hidden subdirectory called ".git".  As mentioned, this special directory can be thought of as a "ledger" that keeps track of local changes that you make. Each time you make a change to the local files, the "ledger" within the .git subdirectory will be updated. If this is the first time that you have cloned a repo, you should go ahead and display the contents of the repo directory and ensure that you see the .git subdirectory.  If you are using the command line to list the files, use the command "dir /a" (for Windows) or "ls -al" (for Mac/Linux).  If you are using a graphical file manager program to view files, then make sure that its option to "show hidden files" is on.</p>
  
  <h3><img src="../../Images/small/w4.jpg" alt=" " class="heading-icon"/> git status</h3>
  <p><b>Syntax:</b></p>
  <pre><span class="inner-pre" style="font-size: 10px">
    git status
  </span></pre>
  <div style="text-align:center;"><img src="../../Images/commands/status.jpg" alt=" " style="width: 500px;padding-bottom:0.2em"/><br /><i>git status only shows local status</i></div>

  <p>This command gives you a high (very high) level summary of the basic status of the local repo.  This command is marked with a warning icon because it is insidious in its meaning.  If you have made changes to your local repo, it will kindly indicate that you have done so. It will tell you if you have made a local change but have not yet added that change to the staging area.  It will tell you if you have things in the staging area but you have not yet committed those changes to the commit area. If you have commited something it will remind you that you need to push it up to the remote. However, it will not tell you the status of your local repo compared to the version up on the remote.  In other words, if someone, say George, had changed something on this branch up on the remote and then you execute the "git status" command, George's changes will not be reflected and the status results will give you a false sense of security that your local repository is up to date, implying that it is up-to-date with the remote version.</p>
  <p>Here is a typical use of the git status command:</p>
    <pre><span class="inner-pre" style="font-size: 10px">
     C:\Users\jsmith\raptor&gt;git status
     On branch master
     Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 1 commit.
     (use "git push" to publish your local commits)
     nothing to commit, working tree clean
    </span></pre>
  <p>The results of the command indicate that you had made a change to your local repository and had staged and committed it, because it says "use git push to publish your local commits".  It also says "Your branch is ahead of origin/master by 1 commit.  But, again, what if someone else's change has been pushed into the branch up on the remote?  The status command is not going to let you know about that. The status command only has information about the <i>local</i> repo, it knows nothing about the remote repo.  That is why it is important to know the Git commands that take the remote repo into account.</p>
  <p>In this example, George's change is on the remote, but the local repo and its local ledger know nothing about it.  So git status is not as thorough as you may think.  Instead, you need to run the "git remote update" command (discussed below) in order to get your local ledger up-to-date with the remote ledger, thereby giving your local ledger new information about what is up on the remote.  That is very confusing but think about it like a card catalog that you have for your library in the basement.  Your card catalog (local ledger) must be updated with the same information as in the public library's (remote) card catalog in order to be 100% accurate.  We will revisit the status command after presenting the "remote update" command next.</p>
 
  <h3>git remote update</h3>
  <p><b>Syntax:</b></p>
  <pre><span class="inner-pre" style="font-size: 10px">
    git remote update
  </span></pre>
  <div style="text-align:center;"><img src="../../Images/commands/remoteupdate.jpg" alt=" " style="width: 500px;padding-bottom:0.2em"/><br /><i>git remote update</i></div>

  <p>This command is your buddy.  It interacts with the remote repo's ledger and downloads the latest information about the remote repo down to and updates your local ledger.  Think of it like having a copy of a newspaper from three days ago that you had delivered to you.  Obviously, new things have been going on since the last three days, but your "git status" command will know nothing about the outside world.  That is where the "git remote update" command comes in.  It will update the ledger or table of contents of your newspaper (not the actual articles) with what is on the remote repo.  So, in the George example, running "git remote update" will update your local ledger with new information about changes that have been made on the remote.  Again, this is like updating a ledger or table of contents, but does not actually download any file changes to your laptop.  That work is done by the "git pull" command, which will will discuss later on.</p>
  <p>The syntax for this command is shown, where it is first preceeded by a "git status", then the "git remote update", and then, finally, followed by another "git status".</p>
  <pre><span class="inner-pre" style="font-size: 10px">
    C:\Users\jsmith\raptor&gt; git status
    On branch master
    Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 1 commit.
      (use "git push" to publish your local commits)
    nothing to commit, working tree clean
    (in the above output, you may be thinking that you are ahead of the remote repo)

    C:\Users\jsmith\raptor&gt; git remote update
    Fetching origin
    remote: Enumerating objects: 3, done.
    remote: Counting objects: 100% (3/3), done.
    remote: Compressing objects: 100% (3/3), done.
    remote: Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
    Unpacking objects: 100% (3/3), done.
    From https://github.com/cobinrox/raptor
       4774a43..0efb138  master     -&gt; origin/master
    (the above command actually connects with the remote to get the latest list of changes)

    C:\Users\jsmith\raptor&gt; git status
    On branch master
    Your branch and 'origin/master' have diverged,
    and have 1 and 1 different commits each, respectively.
      (use "git pull" to merge the remote branch into yours)
    nothing to commit, working tree clean
    (re-running the status command once again, now reflects that you are actually out of sync with the remote)
  </span></pre>   
  <p>Again, when using "git status", be cognizant of what it is <i>not</i> showing you <i>unless</i> you execute a "git remote update" first.  Other wise you may be lulled into a false sense of security in thinking that there were no changes made up on the remote that you need to worry about.</p> 

  <h3><img src="../../Images/small/w4.jpg" alt=" " class="heading-icon"/> git branch -a</h3>
  <p><b>Syntax:</b></p>
  <pre><span class="inner-pre" style="font-size: 10px">
    git branch -a
  </span></pre>
  <p>This command lists all of the branches of a repository, <i>as far as the local ledger is aware</i>.  Its also marked with a warning because I've seen users use this command to list the branches of a given repo (on their laptop), but be unaware that there have been new branches added to the remote repo since the user had performed a clone.  Therefore, it is advised to run the "git remote update" command before running this command. An example of using this command is shown here:</p>
  <pre><span class="inner-pre" style="font-size: 10px">
    C:\Users\jsmith\gitprojects\raptor&gt;git branch -a
    * master
    remotes/origin/HEAD -&gt; origin/master
    remotes/origin/master
    remotes/origin/amys_feature_change_gui_name
    remotes/origin/bills_feature_remove_dead_code
    remotes/origin/dexters_feature_add_comments
  </span></pre>
  <p>Again, don't be confused when a teammate tells you that there is a branch that you need to checkout (we'll get to that command next) but you cannot "see" the branch when you use the "git branch -a" command.  I saw this situation happen with a very confused QA tester who insisted that a developer's branch "is not there", insisting that the individual never pushed up the branch.  The problem was that the QA tester had cloned the repo several days earlier and the developer had since uploaded his fixes to a new branch which the QA tester did not see until he ran the "git remote update", followed by "git branch -a"</p>

  <h3><img src="../../Images/small/w4.jpg" alt=" " class="heading-icon"/> git checkout/checkout -b</h3>
  <p><b>Syntax</b></p>
  <pre><span class="inner-pre" style="font-size: 10px">
    git checkout &lt;branch_name&gt;
    git checkout -b &lt;new_branch_name&gt;
  </span></pre>
  <div style="text-align:center;"><img src="../../Images/commands/checkout.jpg" alt=" " style="width: 500px;padding-bottom:0.2em"/><br /><i>git checkout existing branch and checkout, creating a new branch</i></div>
  <p>This command is normally used to either "checkout" or change to a different branch on your local repo, or to create a new branch on your local repo.  It is marked with a warning because it does not interact with the remote repo at all and it can be confusing.  Checkout, in this command, means to change over to another branch that your local repo/ledger knows about. As shown in the figure above, for example, if Amy's branch were available locally, you could checkout her branch.  However, if Fred had uploaded a new branch, called, let's say, feature_fix_preamble, but you have not run a "get remote update" command in a while, your local repo/ledger will not be aware at all of Fred's branch.  So if Fred tells you to "checkhout the feature_fix_preamble" branch, you may not be able to check it out and you may not even see it if you run the "git branch -a" command.  So be sure to run "git remote update" before trying to checkout to a different branch.  Finally, although we have not discussed the "pull" command in detail, it is always good practice to run the "git pull" command when checking out someone else's branch to ensure that you pull down the most recent version of the branch from the remote repo.  This rather verbose scenario is shown in the example syntax below where the user first runs "git remote update" to update the local repo's ledger, then runs "git branch -a" to list all of the branches, and then runs "git checkout" to checkout Fred's branch.</p>
  
  <pre><span class="inner-pre" style="font-size: 10px">
  C:\Users\jsmith\gitprojects\raptor&gt;git remote update
  Fetching origin
  From https://github.com/cobinrox/raptor
  * [new branch]      fix_preamble -&gt; origin/fix_preamble

  C:\Users\jsmith\gitprojects\raptor&gt;git branch -a
  * master
  remotes/origin/HEAD -&gt; origin/master
  remotes/origin/amys_feature_change_gui_name
  remotes/origin/bills_feature_remove_dead_code
  remotes/origin/dexters_feature_add_comments
  remotes/origin/freds_fix_preamble
  remotes/origin/master

  C:\Users\jsmith\gitprojects\raptor&gt;git checkout fix_preamble
  Branch fix_preamble set up to track remote branch fix_preamble from origin.
  Switched to a new branch 'fix_preamble'
  </span></pre>
<p>As mentioned, the checkout  command is also used to actually <i>create</i> a new branch in your local repo.  For example, if you are assigned the work to change the sort algorithm of a piece of code, you would normally use the checkout command with the "-b" flag, indicating that you want to create a new branch.  The syntax of using the command for this scenario is shown below.</p>
<pre><span class="inner-pre" style="font-size: 10px">
  C:\Users\jsmith&gt;git checkout -b feature_change_sort
  Switched to a new branch 'feature_change_sort'
  </span></pre>
  <p>The purpose of the checkout command is to allow a developer to change over to colleagues' branches without having to download and create new directories to specifically for working with the colleagues' branches.  Instead, the ideal workflow is something like this:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Developer Amy is working with her local repo on her own branch, called, feature_a.</li>
    <li>Developer Bill is having a problem with his branch, feature_b, and so asks Developer Amy to take a log at it.</li>
    <li>Developer Bill pushes his branch up to the remote repo so that Developer Amy can check it out.</li>
    <li>Developer Amy runs "git remote update", "get checkout feature_b", and "git pull."  </li>
    <li>Developer Amy can now look at Developer Bill's code and help find the problem and let Developer Bill know about the problem.</li>
    <li>Developer Amy can now checkout her feature_a branch again and continue working on her feature.</li>
  </ol>
  The above scenario shows the benefit of Git in that you can checkout someone elses code without having to save it to a separate directory and then, when you are done looking at that other branch, you can go checkout your original branch and continue with your work.  It is as if Git is creating subdirectories of your branch and the other branch and they are separated and clean. The problem with the scenario is that it only works when, before doing a checkout of someone else's branch, you have <i>remembered to add and commit your own branch first</i>.
