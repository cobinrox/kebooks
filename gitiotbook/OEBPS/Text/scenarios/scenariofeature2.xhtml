<h3>Scenario: Creating New Feature Branch Before Your Old Feature Branch has been Merged</h3>
<p>Suppose that you have finished up Feature X (for example, adding the 28th amendment) and you are ready to work on a new feature, Feature Y (for example, Feature Y is to  remove amendment number 2).  But also suppose that Greg the gargoyle/CM person has not yet officially merged Feature X into the parent branch.  But you'll need that feature/fix in order to finish Feature Y (because you'll need to include the new 28th amendment text moving forward). In other words, you need to start a new branch, but you need the changes from your previous branch as the parent.</p>
<p>This can get tricky, but doesn't have to be as complicated as it sounds.  For this scenario you "simply" go ahead and create Feature Y from Feature X and, instead of occaisionally pulling and merging from Feature X as the parent, you pull and merge from the sprint parent, for example, a "develop" branch as shown in the diagram below.</p>
