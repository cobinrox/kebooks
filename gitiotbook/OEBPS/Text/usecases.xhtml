<h1>Git Use Cases</h1>
<h3>Goals for this Chapter</h3>
<p>By the end of this chapter, you should be able to answer the following questions confidently</p>
<ul>
  <li>If a user, Dave,  says that he has committed his changes to his branch and you then download his branch from the remote repo, why aren't you seeing any of Dave's changes??</li>
  <li>If a user, Jill, commits her changes to a common branch, but then wants to "undo" the changes, can she do so without affecting other users who may also have downloaded and currently be using that branch?</li>
  <li>If a user, Sally, creates a new branch, then pushes it to the remote repo, and you do a "git branch -a" command on your laptop, why do you not see Sally's branch at all?</li>
  <li>If a user, Nick, removes a sensitive file (like business actuals) from the branch that he and Jean are working on and then pushes the branch, why is the file still on Jean's local repo after she does a git pull of the branch? It shouldn't be if the sensitive file is "tracked".</li>
</ul>
