<h1>Git: Hands On</h1>
<p>This chapter presents a set of hands-on use cases that you can walk through to get yourself comfortable with Git.  It starts with first installing several tools, including Git itself.  After that, it walks you through an example of creating a remote Github account and repository, then presents the meat of the chapter: use cases and situations you are likely to encounter in real life.  As always, you can skip over any section if you are already familiar with it, but it may be worthwhile to go through the sections one-by-one to build up progress.</p>
<p>Here are the use cases in this chapter:</p>  
<ul>
  <li>Tool Installation: install Git locally, and a few helper tools including VSCode and SourceTree</li>
  <li>Local Repo Exercise: get familiar with basic local Git commands and the helper tools</li>
  <li>
</ul>
