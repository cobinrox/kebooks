<h1>BRANCHING WORKFLOWS</h1>
<p>
This is probably the most boring chapter, but also the most important.&ensp;In today's market, you need to understand various branching workflows, whether you agree that they are a good idea or not.&ensp;If you don't understand branching workflows, you may stumble when trying to understand Git.&ensp;
If you are certain that you understand the nuances of a basic branching strategy,&ensp;you may want to skip this chapter.&ensp;But if the phrase "Did you merge your branch into the master?" seems perfectly fine to you, then you might want to browse through the sections herein.&ensp;
In fact, after reading through this chapter, it is hoped that you will be able to answer the following questions (no this is not a test, but it is important):
</p>
<ul>
    <li>How do you prevent developer X's changes breaking the changes that developer Y made last week? (answer: Developer X cannot merge into the master remote repo until they have merged the master into your their branch themselves locally on their machine and a) have unmangled any collisions all locally; AND b) make sure unit tests still work after merging master into their branch locally</li>
    
  </ul>
  

<p>
  This chapter brings you up to speed with the primary concept of branching workflows, with the following sub-sections:
</p>
  <ul>
  <li>The Wild West No-Branching Workflow</li>
  <li>The Branching Workflow</li>
  <li>The Simple but Safe Branching Workflow</li>
  <li>The Branching-on-Steroids Branching Workflow</li>
  </ul>

<h3>Terms</h3>
Before presenting the workflows, a few definition/terms are provided below.  Note that all of the definitions that are presented in each chapter are duplicated at the end of the book in a Glossary chapter.
