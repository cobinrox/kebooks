<h1>Introduction -- from the editor</h1>
<h2>Heads Like These!</h2>
<div style="font-size:80%; text-align:center;"><img src="../Images/heads1.jpg" class='imgrb' alt=" " style="padding-bottom:0.2em"/><br /><i>Heads !</i></div>

<p><b>Heads? Heads?</b> <i>Heads</i> is a general term that is used to describe a population or group.  For example, when driving down an interstate and a mini-van is in front of you, what do you see? Heads.  Or, when you are hiking on a popular steep hiking trail, and stop to take a look to see who all is behind you, what do you see? More heads.  Finally, when it is a Saturday afternoon and inside the store you turn a corner to approach a check-out lane, what are you confronted by? Heads, of course.</p>

 
 

<p>This book provides recipes that heads like!  They have been tested on many heads and have been proven to be well-received.  So when Gramma Vi says "Heads Like This!", you can be assured that the resulting concoction will be consumed like a mad heard of zombies chowing down a pit of rotting brains.</p>

<h2>Unique Ingredients</h2>

<p>These recipes are well-received by heads, and you may find new, unusual, or unexpected ingredients in some of them.  Take the <i>What-Causes-That-Crunch? Easy Potato Salad</i>, the <i>Oh-That's-How-You-Make-it-So-Good Pie Crust</i>, or the beloved <i>Coke&#174; Cake</i>-- they all have some interesting embellishments.</p>

<h2>Experiment and Substitute</h2>

<p>While heads like these recipes (and heads like food), be advised that not all heads will snarf down all recipes with the same zeal. Flavour, taste, and all-around yumminess <i>is</i> subjective: Therefore some recipes will appeal to certain heads, while others may not appeal as much.    Onions, for example, are a polarizing subject in some circles of heads and could therefore be left out of otherwise perfectly-acceptable dishes. </p> 

 <div style="width:375 px; font-size:80%; text-align:center;"><img src="../Images/onion.jpg" alt=" " width="500" height="375" style="padding-bottom:0.2em"/><br /><i>Be sensitive to potent foods.</i></div> 

<p>The <i>dark side</i> is also sought out by a small but discerning band of heads; no, not <i>dark</i> as in dark chocolate, but dark as in BURNED.  Like burned cookies, burned toast, and burned crust. So feel free to substitute cooking times, leave as-is, or burn as needed.</p>

<p>And don't forget the vegans: some recipes can be easily converted to a vegan's approval.</p>

<p>As for nutritional value, be wary of some of the desserts or meals that involve cream-- substitute as you deem necessary.</p>

<h2>Bang-for-the-Buck</h2>
<p>Some of the recipes are time-consuming.  But, the bang-for-the-buck ratio is usually a high number.  For those recipes that take longer time than is usual, a bang-for-the-buck icon is provided to remind you that you will be pleased with the reception of the final product.</p>

<h2>Book Format</h2>
<p>The recipies are annotated with a useful set of icons, described below.</p>
